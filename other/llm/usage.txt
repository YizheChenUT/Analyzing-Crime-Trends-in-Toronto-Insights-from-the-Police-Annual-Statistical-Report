Abstract
This paper examines the 2023 Toronto Police Annual Statistical Report on reported crimes, focusing on crime distribution across various types and regions within the city. Using publicly available data from Open Data Toronto, we explore crime patterns from 2018 to 2022. Findings suggest that downtown areas report the highest number of incidents, especially in theft and assault. These insights are crucial for understanding how to allocate resources effectively to mitigate crime and enhance public safety.

Introduction
Crime remains a key concern for Toronto’s residents and policymakers. Understanding where and how crimes occur can inform decisions on policing strategies, resource distribution, and community support. This paper examines the latest Toronto Police Annual Statistical Report, exploring reported crimes by type and location across the city’s 25 wards. Specifically, we focus on the most common crime types, such as theft, robbery, and assault, and analyze how these crimes are distributed geographically.

Toronto’s crime statistics have shown some fluctuations over recent years, particularly influenced by factors such as population density and economic conditions. While downtown Toronto has traditionally seen higher crime rates due to its dense population and economic activity, suburbs also report significant incidents, especially involving domestic violence and property crime.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the data and its source, Section 3 shows the results of the analysis, and Section 4 discusses the findings and their implications for future crime prevention strategies.

Data Download Script
You already have the code to download the dataset from Open Data Toronto. Here’s how you can organize it into your 01-download_data.R script:

scripts/01-download_data.R
# scripts/01-download_data.R

# Load necessary libraries
library(opendatatoronto)
library(dplyr)

# Get package
package <- show_package("police-annual-statistical-report-reported-crimes")

# Get all resources for this package
resources <- list_package_resources("police-annual-statistical-report-reported-crimes")

# Identify datastore resources (CSV or GeoJSON)
datastore_resources <- filter(resources, tolower(format) %in% c('csv', 'geojson'))

# Load the first datastore resource (CSV format) as a sample
data <- filter(datastore_resources, row_number() == 1) %>%
  get_resource()

# Save the dataset to the data folder
write.csv(data, "data/raw_data/reported_crimes.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Commit and push to GitHub
# git add data/raw_data/reported_crimes.csv
# git commit -m "Downloaded Police Annual Statistical Report: Reported Crimes data"
This script ensures the data is downloaded and saved locally for analysis, and you can push it to your GitHub repository.

Please help complete Simulating Data.

ChatGPT
You could simulate reported crimes data, such as the number of incidents, types of crimes, and regions.

scripts/00-simulate_data.R# scripts/00-simulate_data.R

set.seed(123)  # Set random seed for reproducibility

# Simulate a dataset for reported crimes
simulate_crime_data <- function(n = 1000) {
  data.frame(
    crime_id = 1:n,
    crime_type = sample(c("Assault", "Robbery", "Theft", "Fraud"), n, replace = TRUE),
    region = sample(c("Downtown", "Midtown", "North", "East", "West"), n, replace = TRUE),
    incidents = rpois(n, lambda = 5)
  )
}

simulated_crime_data <- simulate_crime_data()

# Save the simulated data
write.csv(simulated_crime_data, "data/raw_data/simulated_reported_crimes.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Commit and push to GitHub
# git add scripts/00-simulate_data.R data/raw_data/simulated_reported_crimes.csv
# git commit -m "Simulated crime data for testing"

# Summary of crime incidents by crime type
crime_summary <- real_crime_data %>%
  group_by(Crime_Type) %>%
  summarise(total_incidents = sum(Incidents))

# Plot a bar chart of total incidents by crime type
